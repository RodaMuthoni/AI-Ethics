    COMPAS DATASET BIAS AUDIT REPORT
    ================================
    
    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
    This audit reveals significant racial bias in the COMPAS recidivism risk assessment tool.
    
    KEY FINDINGS:
    
    1. DISPARATE IMPACT:
       - African-American: 1.216 (FAIR)
   - Hispanic: 1.275 (FAIR)
   - Other: 0.941 (FAIR)

    
    2. FALSE POSITIVE RATES:
       - African-American: 0.506
   - Hispanic: 0.550
   - Caucasian: 0.410
   - Other: 0.333

    
    3. BIAS SOURCES IDENTIFIED:
    - Historical arrest data bias
    - Socioeconomic factors correlation
    - Systemic discrimination in criminal justice system
    
    REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
    
    1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
    - Implement fairness constraints in model training
    - Regular bias monitoring and auditing
    - Transparent reporting of model limitations
    
    2. LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS:
    - Collect more representative training data
    - Develop bias-aware algorithms
    - Establish ethical review boards
    
    3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS:
    - Use preprocessing techniques (reweighing)
    - Apply in-processing fairness algorithms
    - Implement post-processing calibration
    
    CONCLUSION:
    The COMPAS system demonstrates significant racial bias that requires immediate
    intervention. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies is crucial
    for ensuring fair and equitable risk assessment.
